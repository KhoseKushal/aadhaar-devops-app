# 🚀 DevOps CI/CD Project – Azure VM, ACR & AKS

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **DevOps CI/CD pipeline** using **Microsoft Azure**.  
Application code is developed locally on a Windows system using VS Code, version-controlled in GitHub, built and deployed from an Azure Virtual Machine, containerized using Docker, stored in Azure Container Registry (ACR), and finally deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

This project is designed to reflect **real-world DevOps practices** and is suitable for **DevOps Engineer and Application Support Engineer interviews**.
